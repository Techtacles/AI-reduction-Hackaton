      <h1 class="w3-text-teal">Definition of Problem</h1>
      <p>It is no news that carbon emission has serious adverse effect to humanity. It
puts humans, animals, ocean, and even the whole earth at risk. Carbon emissions
affect the planet significantly because they are greenhouse gases with the highest
levels of emissions in the atmosphere. This emission has a lot of negative
consequences such as global warming and climate change. As a result of these
emissions, the global average temperature increases which causes our climate to
warm. This warming comes with a lot of negative repercussions such as tropical
storms, droughts and wild fire. To show how bad it can get, our planet earth has
already started some of these repercussions. For example, far away in North America,
there were 311 early wildfires in the first four months of the year in Arizona. In
Canada, there was a wild fire in British Columbia wildfire. In our continent Africa,
there was a wildfire in Northern Algeria on the 11th of August 2021.</p><br>
<p>The issue of carbon emission to the atmosphere is a very serious one. As climate change caused by burning fossil fuels drives temperatures higher, the ocean warms, causing it to expand. If greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase strongly, the sea-level rise could reach 60-110 cm by 2100. If this issue is not solved, it is estimated climate change could rise to about six degrees in year 2030. The issue of carbon emission has to be solved so that the adverse effects to humans such as increase in respiratory conditions will be reduced.</p><br><br><p>Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Science comes in play here because since we have about eight thousand samples of different vehicles, we can use machine learning to predict the amount of carbon dioxide that will be emitted by any of such vehicles based on their features such as: model, car make, transmission, fuel type, engine size, number of cylinders and mpg. These features can be put in a machine learning algorithm and the algorithm can output the amount of carbon dioxide that will be emitted.
Since according to the Environmental Protection Agency, an average vehicle emits about two hundred and fifty-one grams of carbon dioxide per kilometer, the number 251g/km has been chosen as our threshold or decision boundary</p><br><br><p>We target the importation sector to solve this problem. Before a person imports a car, we have a machine learning model to determine if the car will emit a lot of carbon to the atmosphere.If the vehicle will emit a lot of carbon to the atmosphere, the vehicle won't be imported but if it won't release a lot of carbon to the atmosphere, the vehicle will be imported.</p><br><br>The parameters are :<br><br>
<p><b>Model</b> <br>
4WD/4X4 = Four-wheel drive<br>
AWD = All-wheel drive<br>
FFV = Flexible-fuel vehicle<br>
SWB = Short wheelbase<br>
LWB = Long wheelbase<br>
EWB = Extended wheelbase<br><br>

<b>Transmission</b><br>
A = Automatic<br>
AM = Automated manual<br>
AS = Automatic with select shift<br>
AV = Continuously variable<br>
M = Manual<br>
3 - 10 = Number of gears<br><br>

<b>Fuel type</b><br>
X = Regular gasoline<br>
Z = Premium gasoline<br>
D = Diesel<br>
E = Ethanol (E85)<br>
N = Natural gas</p>
